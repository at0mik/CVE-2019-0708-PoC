# CVE-2019-0708-PoC
CVE-2019-0708-PoC
We are working for a fully functional exploit.
Here there are Pseudocodes and Notes.
Find the correct spot in the heap memory pool,
It's not insanely difficult,if you've exploited buffer overflows 
then just do the same thing here(sort of)
Run a debugger on the RDP machine to watch the memory pool. 
Setting the value of ECX to a actual memory address instead of "AAAAAAAAAAA"
will allow you to control the space of EAX.
<< where the shellcode needs to land.
<< achieved by heap spraying >>.
